**Topic: Introduction to the General Linear Model and bivariate regression refresher**

Objectives:

- Characterize a bivariate relationship along five dimensions (direction, linearity, outliers, strength and magnitude)
- Describe how statistical models differ from deterministic models
- Mathematically represent the population model and interpret its deterministic and stochastic components
- Formulate a linear regression model to hypothesize a population relationship
- Estimated a fitted regression line using Ordinary-Least Squares regression
- Describe residuals and how they can describe the degree of our OLS model fit

- Conduct an inference test for a regression coefficient and our regression model
- Calculate a correlation coefficient $(r)$ and describe its relationship to $R^{2}$
