# Our motivating question
.small[A team of researchers based at the .green[**University of Oregon**] aimed to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' early literacy skills.<sup>1</sup>]
```{r}
include_graphics("dibels_team.png")
```

.small[Ann Swindells Professor in Special Education [Gina Biancarosa](https://education.uoregon.edu/directory/faculty/all/ginab), former UO doctoral students David Fainstein, Chris Ives, and Dave Furjanic, along with CTL Research Manager Patrick Kennedy, used data from assessments of 471,456 students across 1,684 schools on the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills (DIBELS) to analyze the extent to which students' Oral Reading Fluency (ORF) scores differed across four waves of DIBELS assessment prior-to and during the pandemic.]

.small[Their study is forthcoming at the *Elementary School Journal*.]

.footnote[[1] For various reasons, the pandemic is a ["lousy natural experiment"](https://www.educationnext.org/covid-19-pandemic-lousy-natural-experiment-for-studying-the-effects-online-learning/) for examining the effects of a particular policy response (e.g, virtual schooling). However, it is quite possible to seek to understand its global effects via just the type of analysis Furjanic et al. conducted.]

# Some definitions

.large[.red-pink[**Statistical interactions**]]
- When the relationship between one predictor variable and the outcome differs by the level of another predictor
- A statistical term

.large[.red-pink[**Moderation effects**]]
- A substantive interpretation of the statistical interaction
- In practice, used interchangeably with interactions

--

.large[.red-pink[**Mediation effects**]]
- A third variable that "explains" why or how one predictor variable is related to the outcome
- Question predictor related to the mediator variable, which in turn is related to the outcome
- Requires some strong assumptions to interpret as "mediation" or "mechanism" that are highly dependent on research design
- We'll return to this in our final unit (*not what we're talking about now*)

# Statistical interactions abound

**Teacher-child interaction quality moderates social risks of problem behavior<sup>1</sup>**

> "We found a negative interaction between early peer context problems and classroom instructional support in the prediction of disconnected play. In classrooms with low instructional quality, children who displayed early problem behavior in peer contexts displayed higher disconnected play in the spring. However, in classrooms with higher instructional support, this association was weakened" (pg. 9)

These are somewhat arbitrary distinctions, as all non-parallel lines eventually intersect. However, the key is to constrain your interpretation **within the range of your data**.

--

Other interactions terms you may encounter: ***synergistic interaction***, ***buffering interaction***. These are subject- and discipline-specific.

# Testing for an interaction

1\. **Create a cross-product term**, which is the product (the interaction) of the two predictors whose interaction you want to test
  + We can create this term by hand or we can ask R to do this for us within our estimating equation

2\. **Include the cross-product in a multiple-regression model** ***alongside the constituent main effects*** of the variables that make up the cross-product term

$$MEAN\_ORF_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 FRPL_j + \beta_2 PERIOD_j  + \color{red}{\beta_3 FRPL \times PERIOD_j} + \varepsilon_j$$
      
  + R will automatically do this if we specify our interaction term appropriately
  + For now, assume you should **always** include the main effects (e.g., $FRPL_j$ and $PERIOD_j$). Way down the line, there are cases where it might make sense to not do this.

3\. Test $H_0$: $\beta_{\text{cross-product}}=0$

---
# What will parameters mean?

$$MEAN\_ORF_j = \beta_0 + \beta_1 FRPL_j + \color{green}{\beta_2 PERIOD_j}  + \color{red}{\beta_3 FRPL \times PERIOD_j} + \varepsilon_j$$
$\color{green}{\beta_2}$ tells us the difference in the **intercept** when FRPL=0. I.e., how did ORF scores differ at different time periods for schools with no students receiving FRPL.

$\color{red}{\beta_3}$ tells us the difference in the **slope**. I.e., how did ORF scores differ for different levels of FRPL-receipt in a school, at different time periods across the different waves of the assessments

## Value (and perils) of interaction

1. As we'll see momentarily, interaction models can be fit whether one (or more) of the predictors are dichotomous or continuous 
2. Interaction models provide an easy statistical test of whether the slopes differ across groups (or across levels of a continuous predictor)
3. Interaction models keep the sample intact (you don’t need to break it down into many different groups)
   + Has some implementation advantages, but the purported statistical power advantages have been historically misunderstood and overstated
   + For more on this, check out Andrew Gelman's, ["You need 16 times the sample size to estimate an interaction than to estimate a main effect"](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/03/15/need-16-times-sample-size-estimate-interaction-estimate-main-effect/)
4. Can be quite hard to clearly interpret
   + Visualization critical to communicate

# Synthesis and wrap-up

### Synthesize interactions

- **Statistical interactions are ubiquitous**
  + An interaction tells us that the relationship between one predictor and the outcome differs by levels of another
  + The standard regression model, which initially assumes that there are no interactions (the main effects assumption), can be easily modified to accommodate their presence
  + Many substantive theories suggest that relationships will be interactive
- **Test for a statistical interaction by including a cross-product term**
  + The cross-product is literally the product of the two constituent variables
  + In incorporating an interaction (moderation) term, be careful about:
        - Removing the main effects
        - Statistical power
  + Graph out the fitted model to ensure correct interpretation
        - Explore the `sjPlot` package for more ways to visualize interactions
- **More learning (beyond course)**
  + Centering and/or standardizing variables can aid with interpretation
  + The `contrast` and `emtrends` functions in the `emmeans` package can quickly test for whether fitted values at different levels of predictor and moderator are significantly different
- **Predictors can interact with themselves** (next sub-unit: non-linearities)

# Goals of the unit

- Describe the main effects assumption and how this assumption can be relaxed using the statistical interaction model
- Describe in writing and verbally the concept of statistical interaction
- Estimate and interpret regression models with interactions between categorical and continuous predictors
- Estimate and interpret regression models with interactions between categorical and continuous predictors
- Estimate and interpret regression models with interactions between continuous predictors
- Visualize interaction effects graphically
- Describe statistical power and Type II error challenges resulting from interactions

.gray[
- Describe in writing and verbally the assumptions we violate when we fit a non-linear relationship with a linear model
- Transform non-linear relationships into linear ones by using logarithmic scales 
- Estimate regression models using logarithmic scales and interpret the results
- Estimate models with quadratic and higher-order polynomial terms (special kinds of interactions)
- Select between transformation options
