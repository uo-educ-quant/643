While it is true, as we've said before that .red-pink[*locally all relationships are linear*], we've identified some emerging issues:

.small[
- Cut points arbitrary and these choices may substantially alter nature of observed relationship
- With large data "eyeballing" linear sub-segments impossible
- Increasing loss of power (larger standard errors and confidence intervals, greater influence of outliers)
- .red-pink[**Overfitting**] risks increase
  + Analysis conforms to particularly to your specific data, but generalizes poorly to population of inference

## Logarithmic transformations in X

---
# Log transformations

- We can posit a .red-pink[**non-linear relationship**] between X and Y *in the population*
- Any non-linear relationship implies that the relationship between X and Y is relative to a particular value of X and/or Y, not absolute (the slope is non-constant)
- .red-pink[**Transformations**] (i.e., spreading out in some cases and compressing in others the values of our X and Y variables) allow us to fit non-linear relationships within the existing machinery of the general linear model

# A log 🌲 you say??

Logs are the function we can perform to "undo" raising a number to a power. If a number is equal to a base raised to a power `\((x = base^{power})\)`, then a logarithim of a given base is the number you would have to raise to that power to get `\(x\)`:

.pull-left[
**Exponents**

`\(10 = 10^1\)`

`\(100=10^2\)`

`\(1,000 = 10^3\)`

`\(10,000 = 10^4\)`

`\(100,000 = 10^5\)`
]

.pull-right[
**Logarithms**

`\(\text{log}_{10}(10)=1\)`

`\(\text{log}_{10}(100)=2\)`

`\(\text{log}_{10}(1,000)=3\)`

`\(\text{log}_{10}(100,000)=4\)`

`\(\text{log}_{10}(100,000)=5\)`
]

--

Each 1 unit increase in a base-10 logarithm represents a 10-fold increase in `\(x\)`.

--
Can have logarithms of different base.

# Understanding logs

&lt;img src="log_scale.png" width="940" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

**Some key concepts:**
- Taking logs spreads out the distance between small (closer to 0) values and compresses the distance between large (further from zero) values.
- Log base anything(1) is = 0
- Log base anything(0) is undefined (can't raise anything to a power and get 0)
- Log base anything&gt;0(negative number) is undefined (technically a complex number)
- Taking logs is a .red-pink[**monotonic**] transformation; doesn’t change the order of any of the underlying raw values

**Some alternative ways to describe this relationship:**
.tiny[
- Average reading scores in the population of countries sitting for the 2018 PISA reading test were 112.7 points higher for every ten-fold increase in cumulative educational spending on children aged 6-15.
- As cumulative education spending on children aged 6-15 is ten times higher, reading scores in the population of countries sitting for the 2018 PISA reading test were 112.7 points higher, on average.
- We predict that two countries that spend an order of magnitude (e.g., $10,000 vs. $100,00) apart on cumulative educational expenditures on children aged 6-15 will have PISA reading scores 112.7 points apart.

&lt;img src="EDUC643_16_nonlinearity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
# An alternative model

The relationship of GDP and PPE are relative to their respective values. The relationship has a higher magnitude when GDP per capita is smaller and a smaller magnitude when GDP per capita is smaller.

--
Can use a log transformation to capture the non-absolute (non-constant) nature of the slope:

`$$PPE_j = \beta_0 * 2^{(\beta_1 GDP_j + \varepsilon)}$$`

`$$\text{log}_2(PPE_j) = \text{log}_2 \beta_0 + \beta_1 GDP_j + \varepsilon$$`
---
# Interpreting this

Can interpret log outcomes as percent changes because:
`$$Y_1 = \beta_0 2^{\beta_1 X_1}$$`
`$$Y_2 = \beta_0 2^{\beta_1(X+1)} = \beta_0 2^{\beta_1 X} 2^{\beta_1}$$`

`$$\frac{Y_2}{Y_1} = \frac{\beta_0 2^{\beta_1 X} 2^{\beta_1}}{\beta_0 2^{\beta_1 X}} = 2^{\beta_1}$$`

So, `\(Y_2\)` is `\(2^{\beta_1}\)` times larger than `\(Y_1\)`!

--
Depends on key properties of logs:
- log(xy) = log(x) + log(y)
- `\(\text{log}(x^p)\)` = p*log(x)

--

.red-pink[**Percent growth rate**] = `\(\large 100(2^{\beta_1} - 1)\)`

.small[Regress log(Y) on X and substitute the estimated slope into the equation for the percent growth rate to obtain the estimated percent growth rate per unit change in X.]

`\(Y_2 = 2^{\beta_1} Y_1\)` is the same thing as saying the percent growth rate is `\(100(2^{\beta_1} - 1)\)`

**Percent growth rate**: `\(100(2^{0.000039} - 1) = 0.0027\%\)` ; for each $1 more of GDP per person, PPE is 0.0027% higher; or for each $1,000 more of GDP per person, PPE is 2.7% higher

`$$\text{log}_2 (\hat{PPE}_j) = 11.8 + 0.000039 * GDP_j$$`

&gt; Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is a strong predictor of yearly per-student expenditure from primary through tertiary education. In particular, if we compare two countries whose GDPs differ by $1,000, we would predict that the wealthier country would have per pupil expenditure that is 2.7 ***percent*** higher than the country with the smaller economy.

# Which 🌲 to harvest?

- Could theoretically select a log of any base to transform outcome or predictor or both to a linear relationship
- Much more sensible to restrict yourself to base_10, base_2 or the .red-pink[**natural log**]; comes from Euler's number `\((e)\)`

## "Forbidden" log transformations
So far, we've been dealing with situations in which all the variables we needed to transform were non-zero. In fact this is often not the case:
&lt;img src="EDUC643_16_nonlinearity_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-35-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--
Many other instances: counts of behaviors, individual income, absences, scale scores, etc.

---
## "Forbidden" log transformations

Traditional approach: 
- Add a small "starter" value to all raw values (+1, +0.1, +0.01, +0.001, etc.)
- Take log of this .red-pink[**"zero-inflated"**] variable

.red[**DO NOT DO THIS!!!**]

- Value selected for starter and proportion of 0s in your data can results in wildly inconsistent coefficient estimates
- You'll address this issue in EDUC 645 with Poisson regression

Effects of a predictor can differ by that predictor:
`$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 (X_1 * X_1) + \varepsilon$$`

`$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_1^2) + \varepsilon$$`

.pull-left[
**Empirical approach**
.small[
- Notice presence of non-linearity in relationship
- Find an *ad-hod* transformation of either the predictor, the outcome, or both that renders the relationship linear
- Use OLS in the transformed world, and conduct inference there
- De-transform fitted model to produce sensible plots

.pull-right[
**Theory-driven approach**
.small[
- Use theory or knowledge from prior research to postulate a non-linear model
- Use non-linear regression (`nls` or other estimation packages) (part of the Generalized Linear Model family) to fit the postulated trend in the real world and conduct inference there
- Interpret parameter estimates directly

## Putting non-linearity together
.small[
- **Remember to check your linearity assumption**
   + Use bivariate scatter plots
   + Use residual and Q-Q plots to diagnose
- **Make sensible transformations**
   + Logarithmic, inverse, root and other functions can allow a return to a world of linearity and permit you to use the GLM tools of OLS to estimate non-linear relationships
   + Best to use transformations that are the most straightforward to interpret
   + Use Tukey's Bulge to guide what kind of transformation you will attempt
   + There is no one "right" transformation for a given data shape
   + Start with transforming x before y
   + Do **NOT** use a "start" to log transform data that includes 0s
   + Inspect scatter plots post-transformation to check for success in linearizing
      - With large data, can be hard to see; consider binscatter options (by hand or `binsreg`)
- **Predictors can interact with themselves**
   + Quadratic and cubic models provide a flexible strategy for fitting non-linear models, especially those that cannot be linearized by logarithms
   + Be careful about overfitting and model instability with polynomials of order &gt;3!
   + Quadratics and logs will often produce similar fitted lines; quadratic allows direct statistical test for non-linearity, logarithm may fit with theory better and/or can be more readily interpretable
