# Correlation ...and causality

---
# Correlations

* Correlation coefficients `\((r)\)` describe the .red-pink[**strength**] of a linear relationship between two variables. 

* The concept was first developed by Karl Pearson a eugenics professor at the University College of London. As we discussed last term, he held many despicable [views](https://nautil.us/how-eugenics-shaped-statistics-238014/).

* He (along with Francis Galton and RA Fisher) also pioneered many of the basic tools of modern statistics, including the concepts of standard deviation, `\(\chi^2\)`, goodness of fit and the correlation coefficient

* Correlations are ***dimensionless measures*** that eliminate the metrics of any particular scale. 

* To construct these dimensionless measures requires **standardizing** each variable.

---
# Standardizing variables

* As a reminder, any variable can be standardized using a simple algorithm.

Each observation `\((i)\)` is transformed into standardized form using the following formula:

`$$z_{i} = \frac{X_{i} - \mu}{\sigma}$$`

* The standardized value is calculated calculated by **subtracting the mean** from each value and **dividing by the standard deviation**.

* The sample mean of the new variable is 0 and its standard deviation is 1

* The new values represent an observation's distance from the mean in standard deviation units.

--

* **Doesn't change anyone's relative rank**

* **Doesn't create a normally distributed variable**

# Visualize in our data
Let's transform *BMI* and *EDEQ_RESTRAINT* into standardized versions:

```r
# Read in the data
do &lt;- read_spss(here("data/male_do_eating.sav")) %&gt;% 
    select(OE_frequency, EDEQ_restraint, EDS_total,
           BMI, age_year, income_group) %&gt;%
    mutate(EDS_total = ifelse(EDS_total==-99, NA, EDS_total)) %&gt;%
    drop_na()

# Standardize the variables
do &lt;- do  %&gt;% 
      mutate(BMI_std = (BMI - mean(BMI)) / sd(BMI))
do &lt;- do %&gt;% 
      mutate(EDEQ_std = 
      (EDEQ_restraint - mean(EDEQ_restraint)) / sd(EDEQ_restraint))
```

---
# Visualize in our data
Let's transform *BMI* and *EDEQ_RESTRAINT* into standardized versions:
&lt;img src="EDUC643_4_correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Note that the scale of our variables have changed.
- The standardized regression line goes through the origin (0, 0)

---
# Visualize in our data
Let's transform *BMI* and *EDEQ_RESTRAINT* into standardized versions:
&lt;img src="EDUC643_4_correlation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
The new fitted regression line is:

`$$\hat{BMI_{std}} = 0.000 + 0.2241 * DietaryRestraint_{std}$$`

For fun, multiply that 0.2241 by itself: `\((0.2241)^2 = 0.0502\)`. .blue[**Anything familiar about 0.05?**]

---
# `\(r\)` and `\(R^2\)`

`$$r = \sqrt{R^2}$$`
The coefficient on the regression of two standardized variables is called the .red-pink[**Pearson product-moment coefficient**]. It is the same as the .red-pink[**Pearson product-moment correlation**] (otherwise known as Pearson correlation). And it is the square root of the `\(R^2\)`. 

Correlation coefficient values range from -1 to 1
  + Positive Values: higher values of Y `\(\rightarrow\)` higher values of X (and vice-versa)
  + Negative Values: higher values of Y `\(\rightarrow\)` lower values of X (and vice-versa)

--

### Calculate correlation coefficient in R

```r
cor(do$BMI, do$EDEQ_restraint)
```

```
## [1] 0.2240726
```

# Formal correlation coefficient

.red-pink[**Covariance**]: 

`$$\text{cov}_{XY} = \sigma_{XY} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^N (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})$$`
- However, units of covariance are hard to interpret, so...

--

.red-pink[**Correlation**]:

`$$\text{corr}_{XY} = \rho_{XY} = \frac{\text{cov}_{XY}}{\hat{\sigma}_{X} \hat{\sigma}_{Y}}$$`

- Pearson correlation divides by the standard deviation to put on a scale of -1 to 1

---
# Anscombe's Quartet

...but, correlation is not everything. [Frank Anscombe (1973)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2682899) first highlighted the following set of distributions, all with correlations `\((r)\)` of exactly 0.816.

&lt;img src="anscombe.jpg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## What correlation does(n't) mean

.small[Here are four datasets, each with two variables with (nearly) identical means and correlations.]


```
## # A tibble: 4 x 4
##   dataset    `mean(x)` `mean(y)` `cor(x, y)`
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 circle          54.3      47.8     -0.0683
## 2 dino            54.3      47.8     -0.0645
## 3 h_lines         54.3      47.8     -0.0617
## 4 slant_down      54.3      47.8     -0.0690
```

All seem pretty similar, right? Let's take a look at their bivariate relationship...

# Divorce and Beef

```

***The relationship between Oregon's divorce rate and U.S. beef consumption is statistically significant. In fact, Oregon's divorce rate accounts for 50% of the variance in U.S. beef consumption!***

# Divorce and Beef

Do increases in beef consumption in Oregon **cause** increases in the U.S. divorce rate?

This is a classic problem of a .blue[**confounder**]!&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;


.footnote[[1] More fun with [spurious correlations](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]

# Why correlation `\(\neq\)` causation?

Common barriers in attributing causality to observed co-relationships include:
- .blue[Confounders]: a third variable causes changes in X and also in Y
- [Colliders](http://www.the100.ci/2017/03/14/that-one-weird-third-variable-problem-nobody-ever-mentions-conditioning-on-a-collider/): a third variable that is caused by both the predictor and outcome; controlling for this can make a true causal relationship disappear!
- .blue[Reverse causation]: X may cause Y **or** Y may cause X
- [Simpson's Paradox](https://daviddliebowitz.github.io/EDUC643_W24/slides/EDUC643_4_correlation.html#45): a third variable may reverse the correlation
- .blue[Selection bias]: due to the way in which the sample was constructed, observed relationships (or lack thereof) mask the true underlying relationship.
- Also, **lack** of correlation `\(\neq\)` **lack** of causality

# No racial bias in policing?

.pull-left[
In 2016, Harvard economics professor Roland Fryer&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; released a [study](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701423) that claimed to find that police were ***equally likely*** to use force (i.e., officer-involved shootings) on whether the individuals they stopped were Black or White.
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="fryer.jpg" width="904" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

As you can imagine, this drew substantial media attention and controversy. We read about this in Lily Hu's [article](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/race-policing-and-the-limits-of-social-science/) in the *Boston Review*.

.footnote[[1] Since this study's release, Fryer has been accused of improper behavior towards members of his research lab.]

# Selection bias

As detailed in [Knox, Lowe and Mummolo (2020)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/administrative-records-mask-racially-biased-policing/66BC0F9998543868BB20F241796B79B8#article), Fryer's results are a product of a fundamental statistical error: .red-pink[**selecting on the outcome** (dependent variable)]

# From correlation to causality

### Three criteria for establishing causality:&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

.pull-left[
1. Cause must precede effect in time
2. Systematic relationship between variation in cause and variation in effect
3. No plausible alternative explanation
]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="shadish.jpg" width="181" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

Highest priority is establishing .red-pink[**exogeneous variation**] in exposure to some "treatment" **OR** make an exceedingly convincing case that whether or not someone receives a "treatment" is a product of .red-pink[**selection  on observables**] (and not on any unobservables).

.footnote[[1] Derived from [Shadish, Cook and Cambpell (2002)](https://books.google.com/books/about/Experimental_and_Quasi_experimental_Desi.html?id=o7jaAAAAMAAJ) and John Stuart Mill.]

Research design is critical. So too can be [Directed Acyclical Graphs (DAGs)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2515245917745629). We have whole classes dedicated to just this topic (EDLD 650, EDLD 679).

# Turn and Talk

* Discuss science communication and how you would distinguish correlations from causal relationships to the average person.

* In what contexts might it be difficult to conduct an experimental study to establish causality?

* Consider the debate around the social science study of racial differences in officer-involved violence. Some of the conclusions analysts reach about critically important social issues diverge for highly technical and opaque reasons. What does this imply about the contributions of quantitative social science to public discourse and policy?

# Regression as a prediction

Regression equations can be used to evaluate the relationship between variables, and to predict expected values based on particular values of our predictors.

We can ask: What is the expected BMI value for a young male with a Dietary Restraint rating of **4**?

--
`$$\Large \hat{BMI} = 23.92 + 1.04*(\boldsymbol{4}) = 28.1$$`
The expected BMI for a Dietary Restraint of 4 is 28.1

--

Technically, there is no limit to what we can input!

---
# Predicting beyond your data

Regression equations can be used to evaluate the relationship between variables, and to predict expected values based on particular values of our predictors.

We can ask: What is the expected BMI value for a young male with a Dietary Restraint rating of **400**?

--

Using our measure, this is not a possible value of Dietary Restraint but we can still estimate the predicted BMI using our regression equation.

--
`$$\Large \hat{BMI} = 23.92 + 1.04*(\boldsymbol{400}) = 439.9$$`
This is not a possible value for a human's BMI.

--

**Only predict within the bounds of your data.**
